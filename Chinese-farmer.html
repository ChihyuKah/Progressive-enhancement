                    <h2>The story</h2>

                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                    came around to commiserate. They said, <i><q class="farmerQ">We are so sorry to hear your horse has
                    run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></i> The farmer said, “<em>Maybe</em>.” The next day the
                    horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                    <i><q class="everybodyQ">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                        horses!</q></i>The farmer again said, “<em>Maybe</em>.”

                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and
                    broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <i><q class="neighboursQ">Oh dear, that’s too <span
                        class="bad">bad</span>,</q></i> and the farmer responded, “<em>Maybe</em>.” The next day the
                    conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
                    because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i><q
                        class="neighboursQ">Isn’t that great!</q></i> Again, he said, “<em>Maybe</em>.”

                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                    impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span
                        class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
                    or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.
